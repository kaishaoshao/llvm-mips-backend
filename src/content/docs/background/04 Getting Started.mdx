{/* <Aside title="Needs update" type="caution">
Needs instructions for building the LLVM and compiling programs with llc.
</Aside> */}

## Grab the LLVM source
Clone the official LLVM repository from GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
```

### Checkout the LLVM version
Checkout the commit `7602d781b03427052c44537fa4b9c2a6da15697c`.
You can create a new branch from here.
```bash
cd llvm-project
git checkout 7602d781b03427052c44537fa4b9c2a6da15697c
git switch -c your-branch-name
```

Build the LLVM project. See all options at [Building LLVM with CMake](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html#frequently-used-llvm-related-variables).
Here is an example: (the `Nova` target is what we will add, so it won't work yet)
> Nova can be enabled after the [Target Triple chapter](/section-1/01-triple).
```bash
cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
      -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=8 \
      -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD='X86;Mips;Nova' # Nova won't work yet

cmake --build build --target llc
```
