This book will go over the process of converting LLVM IR to MIPS assembly code.

Specifically, we will only be working on `llc`, the static LLVM IR to assembly compiler.

import {LinkCard} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<LinkCard title="Read more about llc" href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html" />

We will add a new target named MipsNova to the LLVM tree for the MIPS architecture. Like [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), every line has an explanation in this book so you can follow along without needing to scour the internet for answers.

## Reader's guide

### Running commands in the book
All bash commands are to be run from the root of the LLVM source tree,
named as `llvm-project`.

<LinkCard title="Getting started with LLVM"
          description={`More information on how to setup
            LLVM is in the later page.`}
            href="/background/04-getting-started"
/>

```bash title="Example setup"
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
cd llvm-project
```

### Command outputs
For some commands I include the output that I 
get from it, which is displayed like so:

```bash withOutput title="Output below the command(s)"
> echo "Hello World!"
> echo "Output is after this code block"

Hello World!
Output is after this code block
```
