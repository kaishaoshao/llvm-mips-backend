This book will go over the process of converting LLVM IR to MIPS assembly code.

Specifically, we will only be working on `llc`, the static LLVM IR to assembly compiler.

import {LinkCard} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<LinkCard title="Read more about llc" href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html" />

We will add a new target named MipsNova to the LLVM tree for the MIPS architecture. Like [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), every line has an explanation in this book so you can follow along without needing to scour the internet for answers.

## Reader's guide

### Running commands in the book
All bash commands are to be run from the root of the LLVM source tree,
named as `llvm-project`.

<LinkCard title="Getting started with LLVM"
          description={`More information on how to setup
            LLVM is in the later page.`}
            href="/background/04-getting-started"
/>

```bash title="Example setup"
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
cd llvm-project
```

### Command outputs
For some commands I include the output that I 
get from it, which is displayed like so:



```bash withOutput title="Output below the command(s)"
> echo "Hello World!"
> echo "Output is after this code block"

Hello World!
Output is after this code block
```

## Code Snippets
Code snippets are displayed in diff style shown below. Sometimes some sections are collapsed
and can be expanded by clicking on the `X collapsed lines` indicator.

The snippet's file path is shown above the code. Above the filename is the context,
which can be the lexical scope or an action. For example,
the context below implies that a new file should be created for this snippet.

import CodeSnippet from "../../../components/CodeSnippet.astro";

<CodeSnippet id="nova-tm-cpp" collapse={["2-3", "8-9", "13-14"]}/>

## Errata
If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please let me know by creating an issue on the book's GitHub repository. PRs are also most welcome!
