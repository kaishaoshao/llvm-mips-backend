There are few tutorials on writing LLVM backends, and the existing ones could get outdated quickly.

The main goal was to try to document how TableGen ISel patterns work and make it easier for newcomers to
pick up without just relying on experimenting and looking at exampls from other backends.

{/* This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how to write a backend for LLVM. */}
{/* I hope to explain some things that are not well documented, and to provide a */}
{/* good starting point for anyone interested in writing a backend. */}

With time I aim to add enough information to make this guide approachable to people not familiar with compilers or LLVM.

I hope it is no longer trial and error. Head on to the patterns section on the [tablegen for instruction selection page!](/llvm-cg-ref/selection-dag/02-selection-dag-td#patterns)
