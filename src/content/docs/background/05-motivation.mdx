There are few tutorials on writing LLVM backends, and the existing ones could get outdated quickly. This guide aims to provide a 
comprehensive overview of how to write a backend for LLVM. I hope to explain some things that are not well documented, and to provide a
good starting point for anyone interested in writing a backend.

With time I aim to add enough information to make this guide approachable to people not familiar with compilers or LLVM.


> Copying existing patterns and reading the comments in Target.td and TargetSelectionDAG.td are the best ways I know of learning how this works. **I haven't seen a separate guide**, although it would be very cool if one existed.
