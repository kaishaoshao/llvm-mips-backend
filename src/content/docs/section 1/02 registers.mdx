We now have our triple registered with `llc`. To compile a program, we need
to add our target details so that `llc` knows how to generate code.

This chapter will add registers to the Nova backend.

## Registers
The CPU has 32 registers (that are 32-bit). The general-purpose registers have the names `$0` to `$31` and also have aliases.

We add all these registers in the `NovaRegisterInfo.td` file.

### The `Register` class
First, create the top level `Nova.td` file. This pulls in all other
tablegen files.

<CodeSnippet id="create-nova-td"/>

We have to enumerate our registers as records of the class `Register` defined in `llvm/include/llvm/Target/Target.td`.

The fields of interest to us are:
- `string Namespace` - the target namespace (Nova in our case)
- `string AsmName` - the assembly name of the register ($zero, $1 etc.)
- `list<string> AltNames` - aliases for the register
- `list<Register> SubRegs` - subregisters of the register
- `bit isConstant` - whether the register holds a constant value
<CodeSnippet id="nova-registers" collapse="17-36"/>

With this, we can see the tablgen records for the registers.

```bash title="Viewing the tablegen output" withOutput
> cd llvm/lib/Target/Nova
> ../../../../build/bin/llvm-tblgen Nova.td -I=../../../include -print-records | grep Nova

def A0 {        // Register NovaGPRReg
  string Namespace = "Nova";
  string AsmName = "4";
  list<string> AltNames = [];
  list<Register> Aliases = [];
  list<Register> SubRegs = [];
```

Next, we need to group these registers into register classes.
## Register classes (RC)
{/* https://groups.google.com/g/llvm-dev/c/PZEoHQNCXIs/m/2Rr1W3rYAgAJ?pli=1 */}
A register class is a set of registers that can be used interchangeably in an instruction. For example, the `GPR` register class contains all the general-purpose registers.

- All virtual registers have a register class assigned.

- The register allocator also uses the RC to allocate physical registers.

- A new register class needs to be created for defining register constraints.

Our general purpose registers will go into the `GPR32` register
class which is defined as a tablgen record deriving from the 
`RegisterClass` class.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-reg-class"/>

`"Nova"` is the namespace for the generated definitions by tablgen.

Next, we mention the type of values these registers can hold. 
For our case, these are all 32-bit integers.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-reg-class1"/>

The alignment of the register is set to 4 bytes.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-reg-class2"/>

Now we list all the registers in this class.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-reg-class3" beforeContext={3}/>

### Other Register classes
Since we need constraints on allocation (`$zero` should always be an operand 0),
we need another register class for it.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-rc-zero" beforeContext={3}/>

For the rest, we need another class. We can be clever here and
use the set difference operator instead of listing all of them again.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-rc-nonzero"/>

#### Unallocatable registers
Special registers like `$ra` are not to be allocatd by the register allocator to virtual registers.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-rc-unalloc"/>

## Generating the `.inc` file

import {Icon} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

üöÄ We have our basic register definitions in place!

To generate the enum values for our registers, we need to instruct cmake to invoke
`llvm-tblgen` on our `Nova.td` file.

### TableGen output
To generate our register file into, we use the `-gen-register-info` TableGen backend.

<LinkCard href="https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/BackEnds.html#registerinfo" title="Register Info TableGen backend"/>

Let's see what we get from this backend. Run `llvm-tblgen` with our top level td file 
with the backend enabled.
```bash title="Register info from td"
cd llvm/lib/Target/Nova
../../../../build/bin/llvm-tblgen Nova.td -I=../../../include -gen-register-info > reg.h

```

‚è≠Ô∏è We'll take a look at `reg.h` to see what gets generated.

## LLVM Classes
We see that there is a class named `MCRegisterClass` that is being forward declared. This class is defined in `llvm/include/llvm/MC/MCRegisterInfo.h`. Let's work our way through this file and related files to understand the register classes in LLVM.

All these classes are in the `MC` layer. The `MC` layer is the Machine Code layer in LLVM. It is responsible for generating machine code for the target architecture and is used to for the lowest level of code generation.

### Representing Registers
Registers are represented as `unsigned` integers in LLVM. Have a look
at the small `MCRegister.h` file.

- `MCPhysReg` is a physical register number.
- `MCRegUnit` is a register unit number. We'll see this later.
- `MCRegister` wraps an unsigned integer as a physical register.

The unsigned values are divided into ranges to designate different types of registers:

- 0 stands for no register used. (Not-A-Register)
- [1;2^30) are all physical registers (assigned by TableGen).
- [2^31;2^32) are virtual registers.

#### Register Class
The `MCRegisterClass` denotes the register class and mirrors the `RegisterClass` in the `Target.td` file.

#### Register Description
The `MCRegisterDesc` class is used to describe the register.
It contains the Name, SubRegs and SuperRegs along with other details.

### `MCRegisterInfo`
A static array of `MCRegisterDesc` is used to define all registers in the target.
This class tracks a pointer to that array.

Most of this class is boilerplate code to access the register descriptions,
used by the TableGen backend. Some methods in this class are:

```cpp
  /// This method should return the register where the return
  /// address can be found.
  MCRegister getRARegister() const;

  /// Return the register which is the program counter.
  MCRegister getProgramCounter() const;

  /// Return the number of registers this target has (useful for
  /// sizing arrays holding per register information)
  unsigned getNumRegs() const;
```

### The generated file
We can now look at `reg.h`, the generated file.

Enums are behind the `GET_REGINFO_*` directive in the generated file.

We have the following things generated for us by tablegen:

1. The register enums `Nova::AT, Nova::RA, Nova::PC` etc.
2. Register class enums `Nova::GPR32RegClassID, Nova::CPURARegRegClassID` etc.
3. Under `GET_REGINFO_MC_DESC`, we have the `InitNovaMCRegisterInfo` function that initializes the `MCRegisterInfo`
instance for our backend. (these are the definitions, so need to go in a cpp file)
4. In `GET_REGINFO_HEADER`, The `NovaGenRegisterInfo` class definition, and
5. Register classes `TargetRegisterClass GPR32RegisterClass` and others.
6. In `GET_REGINFO_TARGET_DESC`, some functions like `getRegUnitWeight(unsigned RegUnit)` and the constructor
for `NovaGenRegisterInfo`.
7. Other functions like `getFrameLowering()`: returns a `NovaFrameLowering` object.

### Add to cmake
Tell cmake to generate the register info file.
<CodeSnippet id='cmake-reg-info'/>

## Adding the NovaRegisterInfo class

First, add the `NovaGenRegisterInfo` class declaration.

<CodeSnippet id="reg-info1"/>
Remember to add this to CMakelists.txt as well.
<CodeSnippet id="cmake-reg-info-cpp"/>
Add the `NovaRegisterInfo` class.

<CodeSnippet id="reg-info2" beforeContext={4}/>

Revisit this later when we start to lower call and return instructions.

Now we register our RegisterInfo class with our target.

First, remove stand-in method we added earlier and move
it to a new file `NovaMCTargetDesc.cpp`. This file contains
all the target description classes for registers
instructions.
<CodeSnippet id="deleted-mc-init" beforeContext={1}/>

<CodeSnippet id="nova-mc-tdesc-1"/>
Register the Nova's `MCRegisterInfo` class instance in its corresponding 
implementation file.

<CodeSnippet id="create-reginfo"/>
And include the file in our build.
<CodeSnippet id="cmake-mc-tdesc"/>

Move the target getters to a new file so we can reuse them.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-target-info-tm"/>

<CodeSnippet id="nova-target-info"/>
Fix our definition written earlier:
<CodeSnippet id="new-get-the-nova"/>
<CodeSnippet id="reginfo-cpp1"/>

Since the `NovaGenRegisterInfo` (which drives from `TargetRegisterInfo`) refers to `NovaFrameLowering`,
we need to add that class.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-frame-lowering-1"/>

With this, you can successfully compile llc for the `Nova` target.

The `build` folder should have the tablegen'erated file for the register info.

```bash withOutput
> cmake --build build --target llc
> find build -name "NovaGenRegisterInfo.inc"

build/lib/Target/Nova/NovaGenRegisterInfo.inc
```

Let's move on to add the instructions for Nova.
