<Aside title="Incomplete" type="caution">
This section is incomplete and is in the works. It should only contain the minimum
necessary code to be able to build LLVM for the Nova target.
See [this commit](https://reviews.llvm.org/D88389) for reference.
</Aside>

Before we can start adding instructions, we need to set up some required configuration code.
This contains the Nova subtarget, register and instruction information, frame and selection DAG
lowering classes and a few others that set up the code generation pipeline.

The code we add here will allow us to build LLVM for the Nova target but not to compile
any LLVM IR to assembly code yet.

## Adding the NovaSubtarget
TableGen generates the `NovaGenSubtarget` class. Add the tablegen invocation to
CMakeLists.txt:

<CodeSnippet id="cmake-subtarget-info"/>

Whip up a new header file for the subtarget class in `lib/Target/Nova`. Here we
include the generated subtarget file from TableGen.

The Subtarget is the central place from where we access the target information 
per function. We will include some header files that we will create later on.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-subtarget-1"/>

Add the fields for all info classes. These will be created ahead.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-subtarget-2"/>

Add the corresponding getters and the constructor, ending the file.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-subtarget-3"/>

### Global functions
Targets have a few global functions to define or create codegen passes which 
are consolidated in one header file. Create the `Nova.h` file for our target.
This is empty for now.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-h-old"/>

The definitions need to be added to the implementation file.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-subtarget-cpp"/>

### Registering the subtarget
Include the generated file in `NovaMCTargetDesc` files.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-get-subtargetinfo"/>

<CodeSnippet id="nova-get-subtargetinfo-h"/>

This needs the definition of the `MCSubtargetInfo` class which is the base.
<CodeSnippet id="include-mcsubtarget-info"/>

We need to register the subtarget in `NovaTargetMachine.cpp` as well.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-create-subtarget"/>
<CodeSnippet id="nova-register-subtarget"/>


## MCTargetDesc
The common place for the target descriptions is the `NovaMCTargetDesc.h` file.
This has the instruction set, register info and subtarget information.

We already created this file in the registers section.

## TargetObjectFile
Another class that is required but unused is `NovaTargetObjectFile`.

<CodeSnippet id="nova-target-object-file.h"/>
Write the `Initialize` definition.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-target-object-file.cpp"/>

## TargetMachine
The `TargetMachine` class is the main entry point for the target. It contains
the codegeneration pipeline and other target information.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-target-machine-1"/>

Add the class declaration.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-target-machine-2"/>

`createPassConfig` will be added in the next section.
<Aside title="Pass Manager">
The pass manager infrastructure is what runs passes over the IR.
Till now, the code generation pipeline (what `llc` does) was
using the legacy pass manager. But very soon it will be deprecated
and we'll switch to the new pass manager. (I'm one of the people
working on it).

I'll update this guide when that happens.
</Aside>

## ASMInfo
The `MCAsmInfo` class holds the information about the assembly language for the target.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-mc-asm.h"/>
I am adding the minimum possible stuff to get us running, but you can
explore all the fields in the class and customize it here.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-mc-asm.cpp"/>

Like with other target info classes, we need to register the `MCAsmInfo` class
in the `NovaMCTargetDesc` file. This is done in the `Initialize` function.

Include the headers.
<CodeSnippet id="include-mc-asm-info"/>

Ready the MCAsmInfo instance.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-create-asm-info"/>
Place it into the Target.
<CodeSnippet id="register-asm-info"/>


Lastly, don't forget to add the source files to CMakeLists.txt.
<CodeSnippet id="cmake-setting-up"/>
With this, we are set to implement instructions.
