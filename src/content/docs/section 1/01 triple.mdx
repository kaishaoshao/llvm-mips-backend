title: The Target Triple
description: ""
---

To generate code for `llc`, we should be able to invoke it as follows:

```bash "-mtriple=mipsnova"
llc -mtriple=mipsnova test.ll -o test.s
```

We will register our target as `mipsnova` in LLVM for this to work.

<Aside title="In the source">
The `llvm::Triple` class is defined in `llvm/include/llvm/TargetParser/Triple.h`.

This page basically restates and explains the doc comment for the `llvm::Triple` class.

## Triples
The canonical name for a system type has the form `cpu-vendor-os`.
This is the target triple.
This comes from the `autoconf` tool, which can make decisions based on the
system type.

<details>
<summary>Example: `i686-pc-linux-gnu`</summary>

Breaking down,

- `i686` is the CPU architecture, which is a 32-bit Intel x86.
- `pc-linux` is the vendor, which is a generic PC.
- `gnu` is the operating system, which is GNU/Linux.

<details>
<summary> Find your system configuration name </summary>
To find your system configuration name, run this command:

```bash withOutput title="llvm-project"
> bash llvm/cmake/config.guess

x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

To explore further, you can look into this
snippet from the `config.guess` file:
```bash withOutput title="from config.guess"
> UNAME_MACHINE=`(uname -m) 2>/dev/null` || UNAME_MACHINE=unknown
> UNAME_RELEASE=`(uname -r) 2>/dev/null` || UNAME_RELEASE=unknown
> UNAME_SYSTEM=`(uname -s) 2>/dev/null`  || UNAME_SYSTEM=unknown
> UNAME_VERSION=`(uname -v) 2>/dev/null` || UNAME_VERSION=unknown
> echo "${UNAME_MACHINE}:${UNAME_SYSTEM}:${UNAME_RELEASE}:${UNAME_VERSION}"

x86_64:Linux:5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2:#1 SMP Fri Mar 29 23:14:13 UTC 2024
```

## Registering our target triple
The CPU architecture type for MipsNova will be `mipsnova`. Recall that this is
a 32-bit architecture.

Let's start by looking at the `llc` driver.

```cpp frame="none"
Triple triple;

```
