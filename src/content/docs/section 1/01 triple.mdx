To generate code for `llc`, we should be able to invoke it as follows:

```bash "-mtriple=mipsnova"
llc -mtriple=mipsnova test.ll -o test.s
```

We will register our target as `mipsnova` in LLVM for this to work.

## Architectures and SubArchitectures

Sub-architectures of an architecture are used to represent different versions of
the same architecture. For example, `mips` has the sub architecture `mipsr6` which
corresponds to the MIPS Release 6 architecture. Release 6 differs from previous releases
wherein it adds new and removes few instructions.

<Aside title="In the source">
The `llvm::Triple` class is defined in `llvm/include/llvm/TargetParser/Triple.h`.

You can read more about Target Triples [here](https://wiki.osdev.org/Target_Triplet).
</Aside>

## Triples
The canonical name for a system type has the form `cpu-vendor-os`.
This is the target triple.
This comes from the `autoconf` tool, which can make decisions based on the
system type.

<details>
<summary>Example: `i686-pc-linux-gnu`</summary>

Breaking down,

- `i686` is the CPU architecture, which is a 32-bit Intel x86.
- `pc-linux` is the vendor, which is a generic PC.
- `gnu` is the operating system, which is GNU/Linux.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Find your system configuration name </summary>
To find your system configuration name, run this command:

```bash withOutput title="llvm-project"
> bash llvm/cmake/config.guess

x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

To explore further, you can look into this
snippet from the `config.guess` file:
```bash withOutput title="from config.guess"
> UNAME_MACHINE=`(uname -m) 2>/dev/null` || UNAME_MACHINE=unknown
> UNAME_RELEASE=`(uname -r) 2>/dev/null` || UNAME_RELEASE=unknown
> UNAME_SYSTEM=`(uname -s) 2>/dev/null`  || UNAME_SYSTEM=unknown
> UNAME_VERSION=`(uname -v) 2>/dev/null` || UNAME_VERSION=unknown
> echo "${UNAME_MACHINE}:${UNAME_SYSTEM}:${UNAME_RELEASE}:${UNAME_VERSION}"

x86_64:Linux:5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2:#1 SMP Fri Mar 29 23:14:13 UTC 2024
```
</details>

The `Triple` class parses the architecture, sub-architecture, vendor, os and environment
fields from the string passed in the command line (or in the LLVM module).

## Registering our target triple
The CPU architecture type for MipsNova will be `mipsnova`. Recall that this is
a 32-bit architecture.

### Triple in `llc`
Let's start by looking at the `llc` driver.

```cpp title="llvm/tools/llc/llc.cpp" {6-9} mark="Triple::normalize"
static cl::opt<std::string>
TargetTriple("mtriple", cl::desc("Override target triple for module"));
...

static int compileModule(...) {
    if (!TargetTriple.empty())
        IRTargetTriple = Triple::normalize(TargetTriple);
      TheTriple = Triple(IRTargetTriple);
}
```

We see that the `normalize` method is called on the Triple object.
This rearranges the triple to its canonical form (`cpu-vendor-os`) by parsing a `-`
separated string that may have the fields in a different order.


To add our arch name `mipsnova` to the list of known architectures, we need to
modify a few methods in `Triple`.

<details>
<summary>More info: Parsing the triple string</summary>
The constructor for `Triple` takes a string and parses it with these functions.
Right now we are interested in the `parseArch` method.
<CodeSnippet id="triple2" mark="parseArch" noContext noIns/>
</details>

{/* Let's test this function in a standalone tool. Create a new directory at */}
{/* `llvm/tools/ex` and add the following code: */}

{/* <CodeSnippet id="ex-cmake"/> */}

For that, we add `mipsnova` to the `ArchType` enum.

<CodeSnippet id="triple1" />

Next, we have to add the enum to string conversion for parsing and printing.

<CodeSnippet id="get-arch-type-name"/>
<CodeSnippet id="case-triple"/>
<CodeSnippet id="parse-arch-nova"/>

{/* We also have to add the default object file format our architecture uses.

<details>
<summary>Object file formats</summary>
There is a nice  */}

Since `mipsnova` is a 32-bit architecture, we mention that in `getArchPointerBitWidth`.

<CodeSnippet id="32-bit-nova-ptr"/>

`mipsnova` is already 32 bit, so add it after `mipsel` in `get32BitArchVariant`.

<CodeSnippet id="32bit-variant"/>

<CodeSnippet id="64bit-variant"/>

<Details title="Why is this required?">
I am not sure myself. It seems like this is used for the LLVM JIT engine but if you 
know more, please let me know (the GitHub repo url is at the top-right of this page!).
</Details>


### Setting up the target in CMake

The target files live in the `llvm/lib/Target/` directory.
We add our directory `Nova` here and add our target
the list of all targets in `llvm/CMakeLists.txt`.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-all-targets-cmake"/>

Create the `CMakeLists.txt` file in our `Nova` directory.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-cmake1"/>

<Details title="Todo (for the author)" type="warning">
`LINK_COMPONENTS` does not appear to be required. Removing that section still compiles
`llc` with our target. Figure out why that is so.
</Details>

Finish by adding our source file `MipsNovaTargetMachine.cpp` to the same directory.
We will get back to this later to fill in the required methods. Right now, this will
enable us to compile `llc` with `mipsnova`.
<CodeSnippet id="nova-tm-cpp"/>

## Build LLVM with our target 
Now, build LLVM with the `Nova` target.

```bash Build LLVM
cd llvm-project

cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
      -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=8 \
      -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD='X86;Nova'

cmake --build build --target llc
```

Now we can see our target listed in the `llc` help output like so:
```bash withOutput "mipsnova"
> build/bin/llc -version
...
   mipsel   - MIPS (32-bit little endian)
   mipsnova - MipsNova (32-bit big endian)
   x86      - 32-bit X86: Pentium-Pro and above
...
```

<Details title="Running llc with mipsnova">
You can try running the following:
```bash "-mtriple=mipsnova" withOutput
> build/bin/llc -mtriple=mipsnova < /dev/null

PLEASE submit a bug report to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/ and include the crash backtrace.

```
<Details title="What happened?" type='danger'>
The target machine for `mipsnova` is not implemented yet. We will get to that in the next section.

Before registering the target, we would get this error:
```log wrap
llc: error: unable to get target for 'mipsnova', see --version and --triple.
```
</Details>
</Details>
Compiling won't work yet because we haven't implemented the target machine for `mipsnova`,
but `llc` now accepts our target triple!

{/* Our target's name is `NovaMips` instead of `MipsNova` because of a weird error I suspect because of the common prefix with the existing `Mips` target.
