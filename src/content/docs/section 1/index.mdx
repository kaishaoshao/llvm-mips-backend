**Section 1** is about writing the minimum required code to compile a simple program
with a return statement with `llc -mtriple=mipsnova`.

Right now, this backend uses the SelectionDAG to lower the LLVM IR.
I plan to use the new GlobalISel framework in the future.

The next section will add support for more instructions and some optimizations.
