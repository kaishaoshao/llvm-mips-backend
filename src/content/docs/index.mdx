    Build your first LLVM backend in a weekend! Find every step lucidly explained in the pages that follow.
  </BlurCard>

  {/* <BlurCard title="LLVM Basics" icon="seti:code-climate">
    Learn the fundamental concepts of LLVM backends, including TableGen, target description files, and the overall architecture of LLVM's code generation infrastructure.
  </BlurCard> */}

{" "}
  <BlurCard title="TableGen patterns" icon="seti:prisma">
    Understand how to define patterns in TableGen for instruction selection without guesswork or
    having to read the source code (although you probably should, lest I've missed something).
  </BlurCard>

{/* <BlurCard title="MIPS Architecture" icon="seti:asm"> */}
  {/* ### 2. MIPS Architecture Deep Dive Explore the MIPS instruction set */}
  {/* Learn the MIPS architecture, including its instruction set and calling conventions. */}
{/* </BlurCard> */}

{/* <BlurCard title=""> */}
{/* <Card>
  ### 3. Instruction Selection Master the process of translating LLVM IR to MIPS
  assembly, including pattern matching, custom TableGen patterns, and
  optimization opportunities specific to MIPS.
</Card>

{" "}

<Card>
  ### 4. Register Allocation Implement efficient register allocation strategies
  for MIPS, handling register classes, spilling, and calling convention
  requirements.
</Card>

{" "}

<Card>
  ### 5. Code Emission and ABI Learn how to emit proper MIPS assembly code,
  manage relocations, and ensure compliance with the MIPS ABI specifications.
</Card>

{" "}

<Card>
  ### 6. Optimization Passes Develop MIPS-specific optimization passes to
  improve code quality, including instruction scheduling, peephole
  optimizations, and delay slot filling.
</Card>

{" "}

<Card className="custom-card">
  ### 7. Testing and Debugging Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure using
  LLVM's integrated testing tools, and learn debugging techniques for backend
  development.
</Card>

  <Card >
    ### 8. Performance Tuning
    Fine-tune the backend for optimal performance, including instruction selection patterns, scheduling policies, and target-specific optimizations.
